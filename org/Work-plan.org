* Introduction
- This org-mode file has work plan / status for the Raku package
  [[https://github.com/antononcube/Raku-ML-StreamsBlendingRecommender][ML::StreamsBlendingRecommender]].
- The central class is names ~CoreSBR~ (Streams Blending Recommender).
* Work plan [0%] [0/10]
** TODO Annex method
   - [ ] For another SBR object
   - [ ] For a collection of inverse indexes
** TODO LSA-FE 
- (Latent Semantic Analysis Feature Extractor) that inherits SBR
** TODO Application of the Composite Design Pattern
- [ ] Abstract class ~AbstractSBR~
- [X] Concrete class ~CoreSBR~
- [ ] Role for normalizations.
- [ ] Concrete class ~LSA-FE~
- [ ] Composite class ~CompositeSBR~
  - [ ] Decide which data structure to use for the collection of SBR
    objects.
  - [ ] ~add~
  - [ ] ~remove~
  - [ ] ~get~
  - [ ] ~recommend~
    - Different methods of merging recommendations results
  - [ ] ~recommendByProfile~
    - Different methods of merging recommendations results
** TODO Parameters for specifying which columns to expect in data ingestion
** TODO More extensive results verification and failure management
** TODO Adverbs for methods [66%] [2/3]
- [X] Should the object be returned, or the computation result?
- [X] Should the recommendation results be normalized or not?
- [ ] Should history be dropped or not?
** TODO Unit tests [0%] [0/9]
  - [ ] Basic development tests
  - [ ] Decide which/what data to use
  - [ ] Data ingestion tests
  - [ ] Core functionalities tests
  - [ ] Normalization tests
  - [ ] ~:object~ adverbs tests
  - [ ] ~:normalize~ adverbs tests
  - [ ] Annexing of recommenders tests
  - [ ] Composite SBR tests
** TODO Performance profiling
*** DONE First-wave experiments
- Using both Titanic and Dice.com data.
- Found out that computations recommendations with ~for~ loop are slow.
- Sped them up 1.2 to 3 times using ~[(+)]~ and ~Z<<*>>~ .
- Sorting of mixes is very slow!
  - I plan to ask in Stack Exchange about that.
*** TODO Second-wave experiments
** TODO Class and method pod6 documentation [%][/]
- [ ] SBR
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] LSE-FE 
** TODO Documentation [%] [/]
- Full-blown documentation of recomemndations computation using hash maps (Raku `Mix`es).
- [ ] Decide on example data
- [ ] Core algorithm
- [ ] LSA topic extraction
- [ ] Merging of results from different recommenders
